Pomodoro technique utility.

The basic idea of the Pomodoro study technique is to work in intervals of e.g.,
25 minutes. A short break is taken after each interval, and after a couple of
intervals, a longer break is held.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --message MESSAGE    notification message
  --interval INTERVAL  interval time
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Requirements

   Python3 for sure.

   If `notify-send` exists on the system, then that is used to show a
   notification when the timer is out. Otherwise this message is just printed
   after in the terminal.
